## Git Workflow

The project follows a feature-branch-based Git workflow as required.

Feature branches used:
- feature/project-setup
- feature/backend-api

The backend was developed and tested in the `feature/backend-api` branch.
At the time of creating the Pull Request, GitHub showed no differences between
`feature/backend-api` and `main`, so a Pull Request could not be created.

This occurred because both branches pointed to the same commit.
The complete backend code is available in the commit history of
`feature/backend-api`.





## Backend
Backend APIs implemented with cursor pagination.
